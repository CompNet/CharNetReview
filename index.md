# Resources
The resources associated to the article are available through the following links:

* [`table_bib.ods`](/docs/assets/data/table_bib.ods): LibreOffice table listing the articles with their main information.
* [`charnets.bib`](/docs/assets/data/charnets.bib): BibTeX file containing the bibliographic entries of these articles, as well as the ones they cite (the latter are not represented in the below graphs).
* [`article_citation.graphml`](/docs/assets/data/article_citation.graphml): article citation network, i.e. graph whose vertices are the listed articles and edges represent them citing each other.
* [`article_cociting.graphml`](/docs/assets/data/article_cociting.graphml): same, but the edges represent how much two articles cite the same bibliographic references.

# List of Academic Works
List of methods designed to extract character networks from fictional works. The *Relationships* column indicates whether the edges correspond to co-occurrences (*Cc.*), conversations (*Cv.*), mentions (*M.*), direct actions (*Ac.*), or affiliations (*Af.*). The *Graph* column shows whether the extracted networks are weighted (*W.*), directed (*Di.*), signed (*S.*), and dynamic (*Dy.*). When the authors experiment with different methods, several values may appear in the same cell. Note that this table has been completed after the publication of the official ACM CS article.
