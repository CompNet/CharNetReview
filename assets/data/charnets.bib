  abstract    = {This Master’s thesis aim is to present a process of creating networks of interactions between characters of films and serials based on transcriptions and analysis of such networks. The paper presents a comparison of community detection methods as well as the use of these methods in plot analysis. A comparative analysis of the interaction network from episodes of four popular series - The Office (American version), Seinfeld, The Big Bang Theory and Friends is also presented. Character networks are compared both in terms of distributions of their metrics and node centrality measures. Moreover, the author considers the hypothesis whether the viewers’ ratings of the series are related to the structure of the character networks of their episodes. Finally, the differences and similarities between the interaction networks in selected movies and series are analyzed, as well as the potential reasons for their occurrence. The author’s contribution includes gathering and discussing currently available data sources containing transcriptions of movies and series and additional information on viewer ratings and viewership. It also includes describing the process of creating a character network from HTML sources. Moreover, it contains extending existing comparisons of community detection methods in character networks and analysis of the relationship between viewer ratings of episodes and the structure of their character networks through the correlation of ratings and networks measures and feature importance in the random forest model. The author also contributes to the character network analysis by presenting a comparison of the network of films and series episodes using the Principal component analysis (PCA).},

  abstract  = {Written at the end of the 1920s, Hermann Hesse’s Der Steppenwolf (1927) and Virginia Woolf’s The Waves (1931), modernist novels par excellence, are marked by the discoveries of their time, more particularly those of psychoanalysis. Through the use of fragmentation devices (of the novelistic structure, the plot, the narrative) or through the complex network of characters organized around a central figure, these two novels explore the new conceptions of identity proposed by S. Freud and C. G. Jung. By doing so, they confer a modernist orientation to the Bildungsroman: the formation of the hero now corresponds to the understanding and integration of the different facets of a fragmented psyche. Nevertheless, far from being reduced to a mere literary transposition of these theories, these works, when taken in their aesthetic totality, actually constitute what could be called – using the verb bilden also presents in Bildungsroman – Gebildete Romane (“constructed novels”). The novelistic divisions and the multiplication of voices generate the presence of different points of view that confront and dialogue with each other until they interweave so deeply that they form the novels themselves. These novels, conceived as the results of a dialectic between fragmentation and composition, deconstruction and (re)construction, thus constitute singular literary objects in that they reinvent the genre of the novel by drawing on the writing processes of the avant-gardes and on a new conception of identity.},

  abstract  = {Story sifting (or story recognition) allows for the exploration of events, stories and patterns that emerge from agent-based simulations. The goal of this work is to automate and reduce the authoring burden for writing sifting queries. In this paper, we use the event traces of agent-based simulations to create Dynamic Character Networks that track the changing relationship scores between every agent in a simulation. These networks allow for the fortunes between any two agents to be plotted against time as a story arc. Similarity scores between story arcs from the simulation and a user's query arc can be calculated using the Dynamic Time Warping technique. Events corresponding to the story arc that best matches the query arc can then be returned to the user, thus providing an intuitive means for users to sift a variety of stories without coding a search query. These components are implemented in our experimental prototype Arc Sift. The results of a user study support our expectation that Arc Sift is an intuitive and accurate tool that allows human users to sift stories out from a larger chronicle of events produced by an agent-based simulation.},

  publisher = {Software systems emerge from mere keystrokes to form intricate functional networks connecting many collaborating modules, objects, classes, methods, and subroutines. Building on recent advances in the study of complex networks, I have examined software collaboration graphs contained within several open-source software systems, and have found them to reveal scale-free, small-world networks similar to those identified in other technological, sociological, and biological systems. I present several measures of these network topologies, and discuss their relationship to software engineering practices. I also present a simple model of software system evolution based on refactoring processes which captures some of the salient features of the observed systems. Some implications of object-oriented design for questions about network robustness, evolvability, degeneracy, and organization are discussed in the wake of these findings.},

  abstract  = {This introduction to the topic of character recontextualization sets out to address a variety of character products that cannot be adequately described as ›narrative‹: Coffee mugs, clothes, office supplies, and other material objects. Fictitious entities such as Hello Kitty or Hatsune Miku have given rise to a veritable wave of literature in Japanese studies outlining a ›pre-narrative character theory‹. Characters without stories, based entirely on highly affective iconographies, often function as hubs, interfaces, or intersections for diverging ›games of make-believe‹ that are in turn often forms of an aesthetic, medial, social, and especially diegetic recontextualization. Consequently, every pre-narrative character could also be addressed as a decontextualized, trans-fictional, transworld, or »meta-narrative nodal point« (AZUMA). Often, these recontextualizations take place within the collaborative networks of participatory culture, highlighting the decontextualized character state as central to what is known as ›media convergence‹ or ›media mix‹. I will situate these discussions within the field of international character theory, arguing that a systematic divide runs through existing literature on how to deal with decontextualized, trans-fictional, trans-world entities. My article closes with some indications on what a discourse often seen as specific for Japanese studies, might contribute on a variety of international phenomena and perspectives.},
